"""The archive of models: their prediction files on disk, an SQLite index of them and an action
log.

A model (`Model`) is one model of a method on a dataset, e.g. one trained network, identified by
its dataset, method name and seed. Its submissions (`Submission`) are its prediction files, at most
one active one per split. A submission of a split that the model already has replaces the active
one, which is kept as a replaced submission, e.g. for download. Deletion is permanent: deleting a
submission removes its row, its file and its cached scores (`scoring.ScoreStore`), and deleting a
model removes it with all its submissions. The last active submission of a model is deleted only
with the model, so each model has an active submission. The action log keeps the actions on
deleted models and submissions. Each action records who did it, the name of an account that can
write (`accounts`).

A method on a dataset can have a display name, which the pages show instead of the method name.
An update sets it, given with the update or from the files that have one
(`irap_evaluation.ModelInfo.method_display_name`), and it can be edited.

The data directory holds:

- `archive.sqlite3`: the index of the models and submissions, the method display names, and the
  action log (and the score cache of `scoring.ScoreStore`),
- `submissions/<id>/predictions.parquet`: the stored files, which are not modified until they are
  deleted,
- `uploads/`: files that are not stored yet: uploaded files and .zip archives, the files
  extracted from archives or rewritten with another seed, ensembles, and the .zip archives of
  downloads while they are sent.
