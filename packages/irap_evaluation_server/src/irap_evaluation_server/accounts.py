Anyone can view the archive, also without an account. The permission of an account
(`Permission`) says what else it may do: 'view' nothing else, 'write' also change the archive,
and 'admin' also change the permissions of the accounts and remove them. The first account to
register is an admin, and later ones can view until an admin gives them more. There is always an
admin.

The accounts are in `accounts.sqlite3` in the data directory, apart from the archive. Passwords
